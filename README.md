## Workshop tasks

### POAP NFTs

To receive a POAP NFT for completing these tasks, you need to follow the intructions mentioned during the workshop.

### 1. zkSync portal and faucets

The [zkSync Portal](https://portal.zksync.io/) is the easiest way to deposit and withdraw funds from zkSync. If you have GoerliETH, you can use the [bridge section](https://portal.zksync.io/bridge) to deposit or withdraw funds to and from the zkSync testnet.

However, if you don't have any GoerliETH, you can receive a small amount by using our [faucet](https://portal.zksync.io/faucet), which requires you to post a tweet as a way to verify your identity.

On the other hand, here are a few other faucets that you can use:

- [Alchemy faucet](https://goerlifaucet.com/)
- [PoW faucet](https://goerli-faucet.pk910.de/)

### 2. Create a project with zksync-cli

The zkSync CLI tool is the easiest way to start developing applications and smart contracts on zkSync. You can [find the documentation here](https://v2-docs.zksync.io/api/tools/zksync-cli/).

To install it, just run `npm i -g zksync-cli@latest`.

To create a new project, just run `zksync-cli create NAME_OF_YOUR_PROJECT`. This will create a new folder with the project name and download a sample project inside it.

It's very similar to any other Hardhat project, but the `hardhat.config.ts` file includes some zkSync-specific properties.

First, it imports a few dependencies used to compile and deploy our contracts:

```typescript
//
import "@matterlabs/hardhat-zksync-solc";
import "@matterlabs/hardhat-zksync-deploy";
```

Secondly, it includes the `zksolc` object which contains the properties of the compiler. Learn more about the [zksolc configuration here](https://v2-docs.zksync.io/api/hardhat/plugins.html#hardhat-zksync-solc).

An last, the networks are defined with the following parameters:

```js
  url: "https://zksync2-testnet.zksync.dev",
  ethNetwork: "goerli",
  zksync: true,
```

The `url` and `ethNetwork` are the RPC endpoints of the L2 and L1 and the `zksync` flag is used to indicate Hardhat if it should use the zksync compiler and deployment plugins.

### 3. Deploy and verify the `Greeter` contract

The zkSync-CLI sample project includes a `Greeter` contract and a deploy script. The [`Greeter` contract](./contracts/Greeter.sol) stores a message on chain which can be retrieved by calling the read method `greet()` and can be updated by calling the method `setGreeting(_message)`.

To compile the contract, run `yarn hardhat compile`. You'll notice that the folders `artifacts-zk` and `cache-zk` will be created with the compiled artifact.

To deploy the contract, just set your wallet's private key in the `.env` file (you'll have to rename it first), and run the command `yarn hardhat deploy-zksync --script deploy-greeter.ts`.

To verify the contract you can use the [zkSync Explorer](https://goerli.explorer.zksync.io/). You'll have to select the solidity and zksolc compiler versions to match the ones from the [`hardhat.config.ts` file](./hardhat.config.ts) and also enter the constructor params, which are printed in the terminal by the [`deploy-greeter.ts` script](./deploy/deploy-greeter.ts).

### 4. Create and deploy an ERC20 contract

To showcase the compatibility with the starndard token contract, we'll use the [OpenZeppeling contract wizard](https://wizard.openzeppelin.com/#erc20) to create an ERC20 contract.

We'll choose an ERC20, Burnable, Pausable and Snapshot. We can copy the contract code and the contract and put it in the `contracts` folder as is (check out file [zkToken.sol](./contracts/zkToken.sol)).

To compile the contract, just run `yarn hardhat compile` again.

The included [`deploy-erc20.ts`](./deploy/deploy-erc20.ts) script will deploy this contract.
The included [`use-erc20.ts`](./deploy/use-erc20.ts) script will do a transfer of tokens between two accounts and return its balances.

### 5. Create and deploy an ERC721 contract

To showcase the compatibility with the standard NFT token, we'll use the [OpenZeppeling contract wizard](https://wizard.openzeppelin.com/#erc721) to create an ERC721 contract.

We'll select the following options: Mintable (with auto increments), Burnable, Enumerable and enter a Base URI. We can copy this contract into the `/contracts` folder (check out file [zkNFT.sol](./contracts/zkNFT.sol)).

To compile the contract, just run `yarn hardhat compile` again.

The included [`deploy-erc721.ts`](./deploy/deploy-erc721.ts) script will deploy this contract.
The included [`use-erc721.ts`](./deploy/use-erc721.ts) script will mint a new NFT and return the total supply and balance.

## Project structure

Projects created with the zkSync-CLI have the following structure.

- `/contracts`: smart contracts.
- `/deploy`: deployment and contract interaction scripts.
- `/test`: test files
- `hardhat.config.ts`: configuration file.

## Commands

- `yarn hardhat compile` will compile the contracts.
- `yarn hardhat deploy-zksync --script scriptFILE.ts` will execute the script from the `/deploy` folder (e.g `yarn hardhat deploy-zksync --script deploy-greeter.ts`). Requires [environment variable setup](#environment-variables).

### Environment variables

In order to prevent users to leak private keys, this project includes the `dotenv` package which is used to load environment variables. It's used to load the wallet private key, required to run the deploy script.

To use it, rename `.env.example` to `.env` and enter your private key.

```
WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY=123cde574ccff....
```
